## Message Encoder and Decoder

- We made a Program for message passing through the erasure and symmetric channels. It includes an information encoder at the transmitter side using Tanner Graph model. 

- We then design spot checks according to a channel. For each channel received, binary code will be decoded using hard and soft-decision decoding methods.

Include : 
- Problem Statement
- Research paper that we used for conceptual understanding 
- Code Files in C++ for
  - Binary Erasure channel
    - Hard decision decoding
    - Soft decision decoding   
  - Binary Symmetric channel
    - Hard decision decoding
    - Soft decision decoding 
- Output Graph of error-probabilty Vs decoding rate in Matlab
- Report File includes concept, code explanation, code snippet and debug environment, camparision betweern output graphs using defferent decoding methods.
